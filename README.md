The folder contains scripts that perform the comparison of the two cross section sets: quasi-free cross sections off protons in the deuteron (Skorodumina) and free proton cross sections (Fedotov).


with_fed_comp2.C - compares integral cross sections

fed_comp_inv.C - compares invariant mass distributions

fed_comp_theta.C - compares theta distributions

fed_comp_alpha.C - compares alpha distributions

plot_mass.C - plots ratios of invariant mass distributions and fits them with polynomials

plot_angles.C - plots ratios of angular distributions and fits them with polynomials
